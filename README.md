# Automated-Report-Generation-from-Data-Insights
This project focuses on building an automated system for generating professional reports from raw sales data using Python and generative AI techniques
 The main aim of the project is to minimize manual reporting and convert numerical data into meaningful insights automatically.

In this project, a sales dataset is first loaded and cleaned using Python. Important business metrics such as total customers, total orders, total revenue, average order value, and customer ratings are extracted through data analysis. To better understand sales trends and customer behavior, visualizations like month-wise revenue trends and product category-wise sales charts are created.

To make the results easily understandable, the extracted insights are converted into a structured narrative report using automated AI-style report generation or Google Gemini. This helps in presenting the data in a professional and human-readable format. Finally, the generated report along with the visualizations is exported into a Word document for easy sharing and presentation.

This project demonstrates how data analysis, visualization, and generative AI can work together to automate business intelligence reporting, making decision-making faster and more efficient.
